Building from source
********************

You'll need an `up-to-date distribution of the Go language for your OS
and architecture <https://golang.org/dl/>`__. Once you have that, just
clone the repository and run ``make build``. If everything goes well,
you should now have an executable named ``ergo`` in the base directory
of the project.
